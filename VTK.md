## vtkDataSet
> In vtk a dataset consists of a structure (geometry and topology) and
> attribute data. The structure is defined implicitly or explicitly as
> a collection of cells. The geometry of the structure is contained in
> point coordinates plus the cell interpolation functions. The topology
> of the dataset structure is defined by cell types and how the cells
> share their defining points.
